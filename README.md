FeatureSelection based on Maximum-Relevance Minimum-Redundancy (importance of a feature measured by information gain)

Usage: 

    MrMrFeatureSelection(vectorModelRDD, labelBuckets, featuresBuckets, noRecords)

    vectorModelRDD = rdd of LabeledPoint // where features are of type DenseVector
    labelBuckets = type Array[Double] // which corresponds to buckets of labels; the first element must be smaller than the minimum value of the label and the last element must be larger than the maximum value of the label
    featuresBuckets = type Array[Array[Double]] // featuresBuckets[i] corresponds to the array of buckets pertaining to feature i (index based on input rdd); same rule as for the labels regarding the first and last element

    featureSelection.minimumRedundancyMaximumRelevancy(noDesiredFeatures) 

run the feature selection algorithm

returns the indices of the features selected

    featureSelection.relevancyRedundacyValues
    returns List[(Double,Int)] // where each entry corresponds to a feature selected. Int is the index selected and Double the objective value of the feature upon selection. It is
    info_gain(feature,labels) - sum(all previously selected features j)                                                                                 info_gain(j,feature)/(number of features previously selected)

Example:

    val noRecords = vectorModelRDD.count
    val labelBuckets:Array[Double] = .... // note: the first and last element must be below the minimum value and above the maximum value, respectively; For example, for a binary case, we need to specify [-1,0,1,2]
    val featuresBuckets: Array[Array[Double]] = ....

    // create the object
    val featureSelection = new MrMrFeatureSelection(vectorModelRDD, labelBuckets, featuresBuckets, noRecords)
    val noDesiredFeatures = 30 // the number of desired features

    /*
     * this function does all the computations
     * fs contains the indices selected
     */

    val fs:Array[Int] = featureSelection.minimumRedundancyMaximumRelevancy(noDesiredFeatures) 

    /*
     * fsv contains pairs of (objective function value, index of feature)
     * the objective function value is info_gain(feature,labels) - sum(all previously selected features j)               
     *                                                              info_gain(j,feature)/(number of features previously selected)
     */
 
    val fsv:List[(Double,Int)] = featureSelection.relevancyRedundacyValues
